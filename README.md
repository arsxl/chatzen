# Chatzen
Chatzen is a basic chatroom system made using JavaScript, Node.js, Socket.io and TailwindCSS. 

This was a project I made in a very short time for a University Project, it may have a few issues that may be present here and there and also follows a minimalist design.

## To Run
- Set up a .env file using the sample file
- Make necessary additions (email credentials, mongodb connection)
- run npm update to add all packages
- You can start the project
